# Singapore-resale-flat-price-prediction
### Project Overview: The project you’re interested in revolves around constructing a machine learning model to predict resale flat prices in Singapore. The ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly web application that provides accurate predictions for apartment resale values. Here are the key details:
# Objective:
### The primary objective is to predict resale prices for apartments based on historical transaction data.
### Factors influencing resale prices include location, apartment type, square footage, lease duration, and more.
# The project workflow involves several steps:
### Merging distinct CSV files representing different time periods (1990-1999, 2000-2012, 2012-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017 onwards) into a unified dataset.
# Data preprocessing and cleaning.
### Extracting relevant features (e.g., town, flat type, floor area, lease commence date).
### Creating additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
### Constructing a machine learning regression model (using decision tree regressor) to predict the continuous variable ‘resale_price.’
### Developing a Streamlit webpage where users can input flat characteristics and obtain predicted resale prices.
# Data Source:
### The project uses the Resale Flat Prices dataset, available on data.gov.sg.
# Benefits:
### Buyers and sellers can make informed decisions based on predicted resale values.
### The application simplifies the evaluation process for flats after they’ve been resold.
